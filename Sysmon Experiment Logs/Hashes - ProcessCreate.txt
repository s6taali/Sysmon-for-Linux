Event ID 1: Process creation - WARUM IST HASHES ALWAYS EMPTY? - windows only option

The process creation event provides extended information about a newly created process. 
The full command line provides context on the process execution. 
The ProcessGUID field is a unique value for this process across a domain to make event correlation easier. 
The hash is a full hash of the file with the algorithms in the HashType field.

Sysmon will log EventID 1 for the creation of any new process when it registers with the kernel.

On Windows Sysmon will generate a ProcessGuid and LogonGuid with the information it obtains and it will hash the process main image.
The command line of the process will be parsed and logged in to eventlog. 
When storage permits a common practice is to log all processes and to filter out common day to day processes for Windows and Applications after profiling usage.


ProcessGuid -- Unique process GUID generated by Sysmon.

ProcessId -- Process ID represented as a integer number.

Image -- Full path of the executable image that was executed.

########################### FileVersion -- File version filed in the image metadata. (Windows Only)

########################### Description -- Description field in the image metadata.(Windows Only)

########################### Product -- Product field in the image metadata. (Windows Only)

########################### Company - Company field in the image metadata. (Windows Only)

########################### OriginalFileName -- Original image name if renamed. (Windows Only)

CommandLine -- Command line that executed the image.

CurrentDirectory -- Directory under which the image was executed.

User - Name of the account who created the process (child) . It usually contains domain name and user name

LogonGuid - Logon GUID of the user who created the new process.

LogonId -Login ID of the user who created the new process.

TerminalSessionId - ID of the session the user belongs to

IntegrityLevel - Integrity label assigned to a process

########################### Hashes - Full hash of the file with the algorithms in the HashType field. (Windows Only) ###########################

ParentProcessGuid - ProcessGUID of the process that spawned/created the main process (child)

ParentProcessId - Process ID of the process that spawned/created the main process (child)

ParentImage - File path that spawned/created the main process.
